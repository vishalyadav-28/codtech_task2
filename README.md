Overview

This project aims to create a relational database to efficiently manage student records, including personal details, course enrollments, and grades. The database is designed to provide a robust and flexible solution for educational institutions.


The database consists of three main tables:


The project includes a variety of SQL queries to perform common operations, such as:

Inserting new students, courses, and enrollments
Retrieving student information
Finding students enrolled in specific courses
Calculating average grades for courses
Joining tables to combine data from multiple sources
Usage

Set up a database: Create a database using a database management system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
Create tables: Execute the SQL scripts to create the Students, Courses, and Enrollments tables.
Insert data: Populate the tables with student, course, and enrollment data.
Execute queries: Use the provided SQL queries to interact with the database and retrieve information.
Additional Considerations

Data Validation: Implement constraints to ensure data integrity.
Security: Protect sensitive student information.
Performance Optimization: Consider indexing and query optimization techniques.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface to interact with the database.
Future Enhancements

Implement a web-based interface for easier data entry and retrieval.
Add features for generating reports and analytics.
Integrate with other systems, such as a learning management system.
By utilizing this database design and SQL queries, educational institutions can effectively manage student records and gain valuable insights into student performance.
